        <p>
        My role in the filming team is the director. My responsibilities are as follows:

        First, we finalized the filming theme during team meetings and developed a script concept. After brainstorming, 
        we developed a story prototype, but it still had many issues. I restructured it and finalized the script for shooting. 
        Then, team members created storyboards based on the script, and I drafted a textual shot-by-shot script to refine the transitions between scenes. 
        Many unexpected changes and challenges arose during the actual shooting process, requiring adjustments to the storyboards. I collaborated with the team to modify certain parts of the shot-by-shot script. 
        Considering the plot and location requirements, we also decided to use multi-camera shooting. Therefore, I also assisted the cinematographer in completing part of the filming..
